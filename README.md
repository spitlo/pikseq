# PIKSEQ

PIKSEQ is an experiment in sequencing. It’s sort of a mix between a pixel art editor and a sequencder,

Pick a color by clicking the color button or pressing keys `1` to `9`. Then start painting! You can only paint by clicking a pixel at a time, sorry :(

To help you, there are some keyboard modifiers. If you press `alt`/`option` while painting a pixel, you will get a horizontal line. If you press `shift` while painting a pixel, you will get a vertical line. Lines extend through all pixels of the same color, so you can put a start and end pixel and the line will cover the area between them. If you press `control` or `command` (depending on your OS) the line will only paint every other pixel.

You can mute individual tracks by using keys `a` to `z` on your keyboard. Or by clicking/tapping the track name.

PIKSEQ is some sort of sibling to [Space](https://spitlo.com/space/) and [/'siːkwənt/](https://spitlo.com/sikwent/). It’s an ever growing family of experimental sequencers!
